Honestly I havent felt this connected to really good nature content since I was a kid growing up watching Steve Irwin and the Kratt brothers. The quality of the channel is incredible the shots are great the episodes are funny and informative. I came out of a really bad spot in my life last year which included being homeless in a tent in a foot of snow and when I look at myself now with my own apartment my cat a job and things I own and a great support network watching shows that make me feel good and help me learn more about the beauty of the world its a really good feeling. A couple months ago I even got a tattoo thats now a forest forearm sleeve thats going to go up into mountains and a night sky that just really celebrates the beauty of the West Coast.And what Id use the adventure pack for? Im not gonna lie to you - itll probably mostly be on display. Ive been collecting books of people I admire and supporting their work and the Brave Adventures book would totally look great in my meager but growing collection. But for the most part itll travel with me in the summer while I show my boyfriend and friend the beauty of my corner of Canadas Southwest coast. Gonna go to the aquarium and Science World and maybe the planetarium cruise Stanley Park head out on the ferry. Fun stuff where I could absolutely use the pack to carry water and snacks and other such things.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>1.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.010375000127178183, 0.9896249998728217))</td><td>Brave Wilderness</td><td>1728848.0</td><td>I have always loved animals and last night my cat boots died it feels like a family member lost</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>1.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.1306240487673053, 0.8693759512326947))</td><td>Brave Wilderness</td><td>2052498.0</td><td>SO CUTE!

My dog was 13 y.o. when she died of cancer. I was completely devastated and cried a lot. She never came to me in my dreams even though i asked her.  She died in November and in March my cat who was only 14 years old got sick and passed away literally in two days. It was really weird because everything went terribly wrong when he got sick and it felt like he was destine to die. I was totally heartbroken. I missed him so much that for whatever reason i thought that if i would go to a shelter and adopt a cat that looks like him i would get my cat back. That was exactly what i did. I went to a few shelters and one of them had one large cat room where you could walk in and pet the cats they were offering for adoption. I went inside and petted a cat who looked very similar to the cat i had.  This cat looked at me and climbed on my shoulders. I put her back on a bench but she climbed on my shoulders again and  she was rubbing herself against my neck. People who worked at that shelter were literally stunned because she did not do that to anyone. I adopted her and brought her home. At first i was disappointed because in my disturbed mind at that time i thought that she would have the same personality as my deceased cat but her personality was completely different. As i got to know her better it totally hit me that she acts absolutely like my dog that passed away in November.  Everyone who knew that dog also noticed that.  I believe that this cat is actually my reincarnated dog. Her soul went to the body of this cat and she came back to me. By the way since i brought her home she never jumped on my shoulders like she did it in the shelter.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>1.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.08283432051660299, 0.917165679483397))</td><td>Brent Atwater</td><td>770628.0</td><td>Thank you so much for your videos.

Without thinking I flung open my door and greeted him with a big HEY FELLA what cha doing cmere!! and he barked just ONE HUGE BARK but didnt gesture towards me (like he was greeting me in response). He stood looking at me but also looking toward our back deck where 2 outdoor cats were watching his every move. He was more intrigued by them than me and half-trotted around back to investigate - but definitely not looking to kill them so I turned back inside and met him out the back porch door. By then the cats disappeared so I proffered him a huge pot of beef stew Id intended to give the cats and he happily gobbled it up but since he was JET black and didnt have a tail I couldnt read him the way Id always read my dogs in the past. Hed let out a bark every now & then while we interacted but he wasnt barking at me so I offered him scoops of cat kibbles and checked out his collar but found it didnt have any tags so I had my hubby hand me our old Saint Bernards FlexiLeash & call the town police but either seeing the leash or my hubby made the Mastiff bark as-if he was upset so I hid the leash and my hubby went inside behind the door. It must have been my hubby that upset him because as soon as he was done eating the last of the cat kibbles I sat on a lawn chair and he sat ON my feet with his back to me and lifted his head up and looked at me upside down...and then he proceeded to lay down all sprawled out/still ON my feet but very relaxed so I hooked his collar to the leash and awaited the town police. When the officer arrived the dog barked at him a lot but didnt make any attempt to get off the deck to get him. He just hung around by me barking at the officer thru the deck railing. He asked if I could walk the dog to his patrol car but not knowing if the dog liked the leash or not I suggested instead that he back-up the patrol car right to the deck to make it a very short little walk... and when hed backed-up the car he stayed in the front and I hung out with the Mastiff until he had calmed down/stopped barking since the officer was out of sight and then I asked him WANNA GO OUT? WANNA GO OUT IN THE CAR?! and he took a look at the leash and the car and TOTALLY GOT THE POINT and he did a funny sorta PRANCE like he was EXCITED & WANTED to go for the road trip but a PRANCING GIANT BULL MASTIFF is almost indistinguishable from a pissed-off GIANT BULL MASTIFF so initially for a split second I thought he was going to leap up and eat my face off so I was RELIEVED when his PRANCING turned into a BEELINE straight for the patrol car with me in tow sorta like a water-skier LOL! He stopped at the back door of the patrol car as he apparently knew the drill VERY WELL; when I opened the back door of the K-9 unit he hesitated for a moment then hopped in and SQUEEZED his body to turn-around and lay down across the back seat and IMMEDIATELY settled-in for the ride! It was a beautiful thing! We later learned the officer took him to the local humane shelter and the owners retrieved him so alls well that ends well.  He was beautiful albeit hard to read and makes me miss my dog-owner-days!</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>1.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.019485787909767342, 0.9805142120902327))</td><td>Dogumentary TV</td><td>1740696.0</td><td>i have same breed 6 month old and weigh 100 pounds import from overseas love my dog</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>1.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.005487231372044071, 0.994512768627956))</td><td>Dogumentary TV</td><td>1854347.0</td><td>I love all dogs and my dog Rollo so much!

I know there was an active K9 Rottweiler on the Cape and my trainer says he was one of the best tracking dogs hes ever seen. Supposedly a Dingo grandson still alive at 14! Ive been trying to chase down the pedigree but never gotten very far. An adult GSD male is often around 70-75lbs an adult Rott male is around 100+. Females are rarely used b/c of the whole heat cycle issue though it is not unheard of. As a handler you must be able to lift your dog into windows toss him over fences etc. If you dog is stuck you must put him over your neck and carry him out.Which would you rather carry?GSDs have longer muzzles than Rottweilers. Heat exchange is done through the upper palate and GSDs have a greater surface area for said exchange and thus tolerate heat better.GSDs are much more resiliant to corrections in training handler errors in training and repetitive training. Most K9 officers are not dog people and have no clue about dog training until they get onto the unit. Such novice handlers are better suited to a dog like the GSD where they can make mistakes and the dog will forgive them vs. the Rottweiler who is less forgiving. I mean forgiving not in assigning human emotions to the dog but in terms of the dogs reactions to the handler/same situation in which the error was made. Nail a Rottweiler with an unfair correction hell remember it and let you know. Do the same for a GSD and you may get a momentary reaction but not a lasting impression.Rottweilers do more damage with their biting especially as they tend to take things to ground and shake them. More damage = more liability for the department.Rottweilers have a lesser tendancy towards active aggression than GSDs. They wont put on a huge barking show just because you said so they often need to see a visible threat. Its much harder (relatively speaking) to get a Rottweiler to bite an innocent looking bystander than it is a GSD. Re: slower maturity that is usually in relation to mental maturity not physical. Ive never seen a Rottweiler with still open growth plates at 2 years of age or even at 18mos of age. Joints are formed and mature or OFA would not allow evaluation at this age. I worked at a vet for 4 years and never saw large breed dogs with open growth plates much beyond 8-10 months. Ive xrayed all my dogs between 6-10 mos of age to see how their plates are doing and whether or not theyre ready for road work and they have been closed.I train with K9 officers and the opinions and observations offered above are based on my experience with them and my own questioning of them on this very issue. </td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>0.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.5122724125685464, 0.48772758743145356))</td><td>Paws Channel</td><td>772157.0</td><td>Ye so true this is what nobs man my dog would help a will dog not atttack but cum on dogs aint all the same at all u need to know Tue dog and its breed because its not just breed that makes it what it is but its personality some dogs are like us and have some neurological problems and no amount of trading or handling will help they need to be distorted for every nasty dog allowed to live will infect our gene pool with our for farthers made they killed any nasty snarling dog towards them and also they breed into them the want to please and also to not see children as easy meals if I saw a dog hitting a Child like tha man with the motorbike I would of shaped that dogs neck and severe his jaw like king Kong mate ways a finger when a child is in need if neaderthols could fight animals with there bear hands then so can we if we use smart over pure brute the dog will loose I mean they aint that smart they can get caurt in snears and not get out were as a human would just lift it of tthem so if u have the dog in ur controls its done for if u can keep up the fight we are more than caperble of killing things with our bear hands we can takre the dogs breath and ones it carnt get a good breath it will panic then just summit and as they do u sqeese titer I have had dogs attack me as a child as I lived in a area of the UK were at that time feral dogs were rith but if he er ran or cowerd I would muster the biggest kick I could and when its moves to dodge ugrab for the hind legs if u get them do not I mean do not let go if its arealy dangerous dog then use all your ape like mite to smash it .I would not ever like to take a dogs life but u f it meant mine or a childs then Im gunna mash it up utill its gone or till some elce can help take my advise and use it even if ur sceard then use that fear as a weapon its there for u to decide flight or fight and a dogs faster so stop face the dog and also f it find ur self loosening then cover and protect ur neck and head as he wont beagle to get a killer blow in if u have ur hand on ur neck and head he carnt move them like we could ye can only get one at a time as he uses his head as his weapon but remember a dogs heads is like our hand to us it can use it t with great efitency</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>1.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.02143497946185762, 0.9785650205381424))</td><td>Paws Channel</td><td>1121154.0</td><td>Very difficult to watch.

I have been through something similar. I was losing fish went from 15 to 4 in a very short amount of time and I was trying everything to save them. It turned out to be my tap water. I got it tested and it contained a chemical from algae that while not harmful to humans it is deadly to fish. I contacted my towns local water district but got no where. I almost gave up on the hobby. I just felt totally defeated. I seriously considered just quitting. I didnt though. Ultimately I had to just get a whole home water filter system that I could hook my Python hose up to. It has 3 filters with the last one being a carbon and resin block to pull out the toxin. It worked and I was not only able to save my last 4 fish but eventually I got new fish and now have happy healthy fish again. Just know you are not alone we all have things happen no matter how careful we are. I had been in the hobby 20 years before my catastrophe happened but it happened and watching your videos along with others helped me realize that sometimes things just happen in the hobby and you cant let it beat you.

Your can you groom my dog? video brought me to your channel and you definitely changed my perspective on pet ownership for the better. I have learned so much from you and you have made me appreciate love and care for animals so much more.  when i was younger i used to have the occasional fish (which died very quickly) but after being a fan of yours for a while you inspired me to get a big tank like yours and care for many fish. Im a beginner so i got a beta fish instead but i did everything i could to make sure its in a healthy and stable habitat and i made sure to inform my mother about every last detail about his PROPER care. Its been about 6 months and he is still alive and well! Thanks to you! I wish you much luck for the future and I LOVE YOU TAYLOR!!!!</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>0.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.7896772256284168, 0.21032277437158323))</td><td>Taylor Nicole Dean</td><td>1663531.0</td><td>Hahahahahahahaha there so cute and hey my dogs name is Gus Gus</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>1.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.07126775895688323, 0.9287322410431169))</td><td>Taylor Nicole Dean</td><td>1859864.0</td><td>my dog dose that to my mothers hair. for a dog it means they were taken away from there mother to soon at least for Penny. thats my dogs name. for a hedgehog l never seen it since l dont own one. but after awhile it gets normal to you. it can also be that its a nervous habit. but instead of playing with hair like humans they chew it.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>1.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.1399457195744739, 0.8600542804255261))</td><td>Taylor Nicole Dean</td><td>2113976.0</td><td>What is your emergency/evac plan for your animals in the case of a natural (weather) disaster?

You can train an animal without hurting them with positive reenforcement and lots of attention. Give them breaks from training or working when they need one! Ive had dogs my whole life. I dont beat my pups when they do something wrong. Ive taught them the word no. I use that when they do something they shouldnt with a very small tap on the rear end just enough so they connect the bad action with me being disappointed and never hard. Ive never shoved my dogs face in urine or anything. I successfully trained my two adult dogs who now live with my dad because hes retired and wanted something to keep him active I trained my brothers dog with him and Im training my two new pups the same as I always have-brief show of disapproval and then forgiveness. A pup their age can only know what theyre in trouble for at max about 20 minutes. Id rather positively show them not doing the specific action reaps a reward where doing the action means Im disappointed. When they do the opposite of the bad thing-they get a treat. Which backs up the I should do this because she likes when I do this enough to give me food and pets and belly rubs! Mind set. And the she DOESNT like that at all. I didnt get a treat and shes not petting me...and I was told to lay down and stay for doing that thing...maybe I shouldnt do it. Thought. Just like beating a kid doesnt really get you anything (but a case) where as showing the kid with them having a positive result in what you expect (school behavior sharing whatever youre teaching) reaps a reward. When my nieces behave well in the store with me (all under 8) they can pick out a juice or flavored water they want. But not behaving means no juices or flavored water. It only takes a warning for them to decide theyd rather behave and get something they want over misbehaving and not getting want they want.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>1.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.20858109788602322, 0.7914189021139768))</td><td>The Dodo</td><td>1113348.0</td><td>This is why Im scared to leave my dog in a car by herself.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>1.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(1.7407704519699362E-5, 0.9999825922954803))</td><td>The Dodo</td><td>1239036.0</td><td>my cat does this</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>1.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.004555409779617437, 0.9954445902203826))</td><td>The Dodo</td><td>1247123.0</td><td>Thats how my dog acts to my other dog after she has not seen her in 2 seconds.

I doubt this will even be seen by you guys but my dog Max is 12 years old and has a heap of little lumps all over him.

We suspect they are just lipomas but I keep finding new ones and they do make me slightly concerned. We dont want to put him through surgery if they are cancerous or something because of his age and the money. He is very active and has incredible amounts of energy for his age.

Pairing it with food and pets/praise etc.  I also learned early in that I had to really personalize the e collar to my dog.  It really is its own style.  You are right about that.  I am only training one dog so I have no idea if this is my style of dog training but it really has become its own thing not like anyone else.  Simular to others but not exactly the same.

If you’re going to use a collar you should never get a reaction like that it’s pure BS. I personally haven’t used shock collars in years but when I did not one of my dogs reacted like this the most they ever did was look around to figure out what was happening(DISCLAIMER:I no longer use e-collars). My dad remembers his step-dad using an e-collar to teach his bird dogs to leave skunks and porcupines alone and one of the dogs associated the pain from the collar with skunks and began attacking them before the skunk could hurt him. For the dog it was perfect logic. Living in the country we only used e-collars or perimeter wires to keep the dogs on our property and off the roads. My dad thought if we had a remote in our hand and the dog figured out it was us pushing a button that caused the pain the dog might retaliate(self defense). I have learned a lot since I was a kid and taught myself better ways and have forwarded that knowledge to my dad. Our dogs have all turned out great and have not had a problem with the dogs since our time of “lacking the knowledge”. Agree/disagree with the *abuse* label its your opinion but from my experience it is not necessary.Again if you think you must use anything electronic it should never cause PAIN! The dog should never yelp or jump/run away. Dogs are smart pain and discomfort are not necessary to teach them. *Most* want to learn and love working their brains.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>1.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.0011135938801853486, 0.9988864061198147))</td><td>Paws Channel</td><td>17470.0</td><td>I wouldve killed that dog for killing my dog.

Whenever people come over and see her in heat I always get told that I have to do it for her own good but I dont honestly believe that being in heat hurts her. To me it seems as natural as a human female having her period. My cat is an indoor cat so I just dont see the need to put her through surgery. The only benefit I can see would be to myself because she is very annoying when shes in heat and likes to bite and scratch my hands. But thats not enough reason for me to have her ovaries ripped out. I can fully understand people fixing outdoor cats but I get so sick of people thinking its their job to inform me that I need to have my cat fixed.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>0.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.5246821352150567, 0.47531786478494326))</td><td>Robin Seplut</td><td>923584.0</td><td>Why cant I have a cat? :((Nice video though like always!</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>1.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.09569605557415366, 0.9043039444258463))</td><td>Robin Seplut</td><td>1070427.0</td><td>wait the mom looks like my cat tiger</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>1.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.024341230384259418, 0.9756587696157406))</td><td>Robin Seplut</td><td>1227927.0</td><td>Lovely lovely cats.

I just recently got a ball python and have been watching many youtube videos about care for them. When I went to pick up my baby I checked for mites and thought I didnt see any but as it turns out he has them. I have been taking extra care to get rid of them (basically doing this every day and cleaning him for two days in a row and then a break on the third). I believe I am making progress (no more spots on his paper towel bedding and he seems less irritated. He is eating very well though) but he still has a few red spots on his belly. Is this from mite bites or something else? I wanted to ask if you can SEE mite eggs. While cleaning around is cage today (the shelf above his) I saw what looked like eggs. When I roll my finger nail on them they pop. Granted I have two cats and we are dealing with fleas at the moment as well. They look like flea eggs but Im worried that they are mite eggs? Again Im finding them on the shelf above his tank. One of my cats does jump up there. Thank you so much for your videos!</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>1.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.0263643497094202, 0.9736356502905799))</td><td>Gohan The Husky</td><td>145934.0</td><td>May you trade Gohan for my dog Apollo the husky</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>1.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.012590311690691997, 0.9874096883093081))</td><td>Gohan The Husky</td><td>203018.0</td><td>I did to my dog he was annoyed</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>1.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.05091923070696084, 0.9490807692930393))</td><td>Gohan The Husky</td><td>244182.0</td><td>Lol watching this video made my dog run into the room and he started howling 😂</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>1.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.24466677296143863, 0.7553332270385613))</td><td>Gohan The Husky</td><td>333829.0</td><td>I might just need to name my dog gohan cause dragon ball</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>1.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.2518268001429779, 0.748173199857022))</td><td>Gohan The Husky</td><td>418743.0</td><td>I got like 17 or 18 huskys so thats why I see ur yt channel so I can take care or my dogs</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>1.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.1329994058081585, 0.8670005941918415))</td><td>Gohan The Husky</td><td>433887.0</td><td>Love this!

We took him to the vet and he was put on fluids. They told us the cancer had most likely spread to his brain and he would have 2 weeks to live. We were devastated and my parents didnt want to spend money on any treatments so we took him home and were given phenobarbital for the seizures. As a last ditch effort we decided to change him onto a holistic diet. More than 2 weeks had passed and he was acting normal again but my stoner brother wanted to try CBD/THC oil to ease his pain.  That was the best decision we ever made. My dog used to have big tumors that would get punctured and bleed everywhere but we didnt want to put him through more surgeries to remove them and about 3 months after we started the oil the tumors started to shrink.  Now the only visible tumors are little ones on his tongue. I truly believe the cancer has gone into remission and Im so thankful my dog is still here and loving life. His 7th birthday is November 24th!!! I didnt think he would live as long as he has.  I definitely recommend the CBD and/or THC oil.  Going into this I did not think it would cure his cancer but it almost seems as if it has!

A family bought him as a 9month pup for a gift to their 5yearold with cancer. Unfortunately the little girl didnt live to meet him and for the mother it was too heartbreaking to keep him. So she was going to dump him in the nearest shelter.My family happened to be visiting the day she was going to dump him and we were able to take him in ourselves. In February he turned six and is a very happy healthy stubborn butt head haha.The second is a BorderCollie/Lab mix named Pepper. He was a stray that wandered in December during the worst freeze wed seen. He was soaking wet starving half frozen and very much afraid.We couldnt approach him at first he would get so scared hed trip over himself trying to run away.But he eventually warmed up to us and told us this by sitting in front of the door weeping poor baby! We let him inside to get warm and dry gave him some food as well. He was still pretty scared so I personally sat by him for the next five hours gently petting him. We identified his age as a little more than a year.Him and Jack get along fairly well and we realized we accidentally gave them a cheesy names. Pepper JackBoth are happy and healthy. They sleep in my room and Pepper paws at you until you pet him. The longer we had him the more we found signs of abuse. Which is likely why he was so terrified. Hes still pretty shy but also very loving!I love both my dogs very much!</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>1.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.0040073170617143765, 0.9959926829382856))</td><td>Hope For Paws - Official Rescue Channel</td><td>621805.0</td><td>Princess looks exactly like my dog 😱</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>1.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.2013267044666967, 0.7986732955333034))</td><td>Hope For Paws - Official Rescue Channel</td><td>628370.0</td><td>Guys please like this comment because my dog got lost and we found him sick and dying the next day he was died 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>1.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.0010129681065645713, 0.9989870318934353))</td><td>Hope For Paws - Official Rescue Channel</td><td>729703.0</td><td>This dogs reminds if my puppy that passed away!!</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>1.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.020499584839739477, 0.9795004151602607))</td><td>Hope For Paws - Official Rescue Channel</td><td>738951.0</td><td>Pray for my dog Charlie I think hes dying...💔🙏😭🔫</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>1.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.0853270137061494, 0.9146729862938506))</td><td>Hope For Paws - Official Rescue Channel</td><td>886228.0</td><td>I still miss my dog he just live here 7 months then My FUCKING BITCH ASS HILE NEIGHBOR KILLED MY DOG AND THEY EAT MY DOGname of dog: yakiedeath: March 16 2017birthday: September 6 2016</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>1.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.13898373949911777, 0.8610162605008822))</td><td>Hope For Paws - Official Rescue Channel</td><td>960433.0</td><td>This video made me cry because I lost my dog and to think he could be down there somewhere makes me so sad.

I was 10 years old when he arrived to the family. My father summoned me and my big bro to the living room with a suprise hidden inside his jacket. Just when he mentioned the word surprise his tiny little head came out just like a baby kangaroo. He was so small 2 months and he was wearing a white sock as a jacket. He was trembling but very happy to receive our deepest love. We grew up together for 11 years vaccines trips to the beach trips to the mall -you name it. Everything. Until one day he disappeared from the house during a family meeting. Nobody noticed because the house was big and the dog was very independent. After a couple of hours a complete stranger knocked the door of our house. He said do you have a dog with these characteristics? and after agreement he asked me to follow him to the next street because he saw my dog. I was worried but the worse was yet to come. He was there lying on the dirt bleeding with flies and ants around his wounds. His wounds were not fresh. Another dog bit him. And so like a father I dived for his son grabbed him ran home and yelled thank you to that stranger. I madly drove Kemiur to the vet and he did his best diagnosis but the answer was heart-breaking: He is not going to make it. Im sorry. With tears on my eyes I agreed to the most painful acknowledgement a father can agree with. Put him to sleep. He lived 11 years with us and now I personally buried him.

Also what heart & liver do you use does it have to be chicken. Where I live there are no local butchers for miles so most will have to be bought from a supermarket nor can my budget stretch to organic. Also do you add all the egg to the food as I read you are only meant to add yolk? Also I cant afford a grinder so is it safe to cut larger bones up or just use a mallet ?

He was seven years old and has been in perfect health throughout his whole life. Sometimes theres nothing you can do and we as humans shouldnt be egoistic and keep our animals alive if they suffer. Dont listen to the haters! P.S. I watch your channel since I could never keep pets like yours for myself. I find animals fascinating but I think Ill stick to my cats and hopefully a dog in the future.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>1.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(1.501465714198106E-4, 0.9998498534285801))</td><td>Taylor Nicole Dean</td><td>528671.0</td><td>AriannaOliverRyleeAlexanderKevlar-my cats namesGlock-my cats names</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>1.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.21579924311254656, 0.7842007568874534))</td><td>Taylor Nicole Dean</td><td>577871.0</td><td>Okay heres my cats story.On 1st March 2015 in front of McDonalds we met a breeder to pick up 3 cats that we found online. We named one of them Frodo. Frodo is the nicest cat you could ever meet. He never scratches bites or ruin curtains or any stereotype that a bad cat does. He was my little fuzzy wuzzy. He sleeps next to me everyday curls up on my bed and even follows me around. He was my little baby. This one time i bought a packet of bunny food to donate to my school but he ate them all behind my back. The other cats that were adopted are Qaswa the mum and Luna his gf. We adopted a cat called Simba that taught the other cats bad habits. So we let frodo out of the cage to pee everywhere and walk around the neighbourhood. Thus his behaviour changed. He was grumpy due to us hugging him when he comes home at night but i knew he still loved us. He also had lost sight on his left eye had alot of wounds that i had to take care of disappeared for a week. I loved him. But later we found out that he had a dangerous and almost untreatable fungus called sporo. It can kill animals and even infect humans. After a month we decided that it was enough suffering. We needed to put him to sleep. I was crying for days even before the event occurred because it pained me that i cant even hug him like i used to do pet him without gloves because he is danger. I cried until I couldnt. But the event didnt happen thankfully because the vet said that he was getting better. My little bunny rabbit is in danger so please pray for him. I love you my Alfredo my fuzzy wuzzy my cina cat. And i promise you that one day i will be able to hug you and pet you without a mask and gloves l. I love you my little pasta sauce.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>1.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.31489248518064616, 0.6851075148193538))</td><td>Taylor Nicole Dean</td><td>618095.0</td><td>Boy: Gizmo or River Girl: Blu or Trinket (my cats name it Trinket)</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>1.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.3289485124170989, 0.6710514875829011))</td><td>Taylor Nicole Dean</td><td>660484.0</td><td>Just wait till you get to the point where hes running around at night and attacking your feet while you sleep. or attacking anything that moves thats under covers. good times.

I have been ill this past year and havent been following instagram or posting much but was wondering how Seymore was doing.  To see that you also have Sabrina is awesome. Gidget is doing great but we found out that she has a malformation in her jaw and lacks the ability to open nuts and seeds. Her physical issues require that I cut all her food small and open all her nuts and seeds. Ive found that a quick smash of a hammer breaks everything up but still requires her to work to get to the meat of the nuts and seeds. Unfortunately she is unable to be released as she now relies on me to prep her food. When my puppy found her in the yard at maybe 18 days old I committed to caring for her as long as she needed...if that means her entire life thats just fine. I dont feel wildlife should ever be caged and made into pets but sometimes they need our help. I have agreed to help rehab another orphan that a couple found in their yard and I am hoping after winter we can start the soft release process on my property. I live in an area where I can release them into the woods but also provide back-up shelter and food if they choose to stay close. Its a commitment like having a dog or cat but its so rewarding. Gidget is very domesticated now and lives a life where she is not caged 24/7 and has an entire room dedicated to her. She pretends to be a squirrel 90% of the time but she also loves to snuggle and play with her humans. The puppy that found her thinks that she is her puppy and they are very bonded to each other.  While she is super comfy with me and 2 of my dogs she is still very fearful of other humans and dogs...I have to limit my pet sitting now because it upsets her and she will hide for the duration of company visits.  Sabrina and Seymore are so lucky to have a caring human that chose to help them as opposed to euthanizing them...which was what I was told to do with Gidget. Even when the vet suggested it when he discovered why she couldnt Crack or open nuts I explained and promised her that I would care for her as long as she needed me...this spring we may allow her to spend some time in an outdoor enclosure that we will be building this winter for the new squirrel. We will revisit release options for Gidget once the threat of Winter is behind us. Unless I provide all her food and she doesnt leave the property she wont survive because she probably doesnt know how to defend herself...so...I doubt that will ever be an option for her...but she might enjoy hanging out in an enclosure where she is safe. For now Ill continue to prep her food daily and allow her to run the house and spend her time hanging out on one of her several 7ft tall cat trees and her huge 6x6x24 cage with 3 levels and swings and her pick of about 6 different nests Ive set up all over the house....can you say SPOILED SQUIRREL PRINCESS GIDGET???</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>0.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.5185385159163503, 0.4814614840836498))</td><td>The Dodo</td><td>2492006.0</td><td>You ar a good guy I love the dog nou my dog juro i will do the sig you do to the puppy</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>1.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.007478609632703715, 0.9925213903672963))</td><td>The Dodo</td><td>2512286.0</td><td>I would always let my cat kiss me</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>1.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.09707706583412178, 0.9029229341658782))</td><td>The Dro</td><td>206280.0</td><td>I used to do the same thing to my cats.

He said he had gangrene and uremic poisoning and it was the kind thing to do.  I told him that he purred at me when I picked him up I could not let him do that.  He told me that was what they did when they were dying.  Again he said it wasn’t my cat and the kindest thing to do was to put him out of his misery.  He said it would cost me thousands in vet bills to take off the leg and he wouldn’t make it because he was so toxic from uremic poisoning.  He didn’t want to give me the cat back.  I finally told him I brought the cat in and I was taking him out ~ which after a heated verbal exchange in the waiting room I did.  He tried to give me a bill; I won’t tell you what I said to that!   I took him home and had a homeopathic mother tincture called Thalaspa Bursa Pastoris which among other things helps dissolve uric acid crystals.  I started giving him 5 drops every few minutes and again told him everything would be ok.  He foamed at the mouth and hated it but he was so sick and weak he couldn’t get away.  (I am sure at that point in time he thought he had died and gone to H*ll.)  I kept it up for 4 hours at which time he urinated all over the floor.  About 10 minutes later he sat up. I told him that he was welcome to stay.  I would make him a cat box and he was old enough to know how to use it.  I told him that he was not to put one claw in my couch and he was not to wake me up in the morning.  (He abided by all of those rules.)   I quickly started adding more homeopathic remedies.  I put together a mix of high potency Symphytum Officinale to help heal bone fractures some Arnica Montana for trauma some Bellis Peranis for trauma to soft tissue like small muscles andtendons and some Hypericum Perfolatum which helps with trauma to areas that are rich with nerve endings like fingers and toes.  I gave this mix to him twice daily for about 10 days.  A few days later I added Gun Powder which works amazingly well on infected wounds.  He did great!  He knew what the cat box was for and he knew how to use it.  One day about a month after he moved in I came home and he was sleeping on the couch but he had left his dead gangrenous leg over in the corner.  (I am always amazed at the wonders of homeopathy!) Anyway sometime later he went off of food; I took him to a vet in my neighborhood and asked him to do a blood panel on the cat. He did a complete physical on him as well ($$$).  He said it felt like he had a tumor in his stomach. He did a complete blood panel on him. I got the results two days later.  The cat had FIP and a lympho sarcoma in the stomach.  The vet said he probably wouldn’t live long and soon he would go off food.   If/when I wanted him put down he would come by my house and do that.  I was stunned! Why would “the powers that be” would give me a kitty let me “save” it’s life and then take him like that so quickly?  Soon he went off food he curled up on the couch and laid there for three days.  He didn’t move.  Being the stubborn one I can be I got this idea ~ OMG he needs real food!  A friend was over and I said I have to go to the pet store NOW!  I think my friend knew exactly what I was thinking and said “he isn’t going to know what to do with that!”  I replied “Of course he will.  He was a street cat!”     I went to the pet store and came back with a big LIVE MOUSE!  I walked over to the kitty (which I had named Buddha Bear) opened the bag under his nose; he got so excited he fell off the couch!  (Now what do I do)?  I took the mouse into the bathroom with the cat hot on my heels.  I stopped up the bathtub and put the bag with the mouse in the tub.  It was quick and painless (I hope) for the mouse.  AND now I knew what the cat would eat! I sat down and told him I would feed him mice BUT he could NOT PLAY WITH HIS FOOD!  And sometimes he ate me out of mouse and home.  A few weeks later I found a mouse breeder.  I had to buy at least 30 at a time.  I got an old fish tank and the mice were very well fed and cared for.  My kitty would sit and watch the “mouse channel” all day and he knew which of my friends would feed him and which ones wouldn’t.  Some days he would eat two or three some days he would eat six seven or nine.  The bottom line ~ he lived another five and a half years!   One night he was very off /  I called the vet and told him it was time.  He was busy and couldn’t come by until late the next afternoon.  That night my little Buddha Bear curled up and died in my arms. I told him how grateful I was for his presence in my life and how much I loved him. Early the next morning I took his dead body to the pound. I used the money I saved from not using the vet to have a wake for my precious little kitty!  One day months later I got horrible food poisoning.  I was deliriously sick and I felt my little kitty get up on my bed to comfort me.  He stayed with me all that night.I think Homeopathy is big in Europe. You can put some in water and spray it on an animal or get it on its feet or put a pellet in their water so they can drink it.  Get a small basic homeopathic kit a Materia Medica and/or maybe see if you can find a homeopath that will volunteer a little time to your organization.  I could but I am in California just now and I am not sure who that would work. Anyway I think Homeopathy is magic!  It works on both the physical and the mental level.  I have seen miracles with it!</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>0.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.7596815305215039, 0.24031846947849608))</td><td>Viktor Larkhill</td><td>1693163.0</td><td>If some one doon that whit my dog I am going to this persion and says # what is wrong whit you!!?fu*****k I hate peapol who doing this whit animals what is wrog whit this persion/persions #</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>1.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.2764649131646743, 0.7235350868353256))</td><td>Viktor Larkhill</td><td>2433277.0</td><td>It have the same color as one of my cats.

Ive been able to teach him the basics but have faced problems fixing his destructive behaviour and whining.Ive a tiny mix breed puppy 8 months old but he has never ending energy even though he hardly eats(he just smells food and goes away) and we play with him a lot apart from two 2 kilometre walks a day. Ive tried tiring him up everyday but still he constantly craves for attention and when he gets that he wants to scratch and bite. Moreover if you do not pay attention to him hell start whining and can go on for half and hour or so. But the most troublesome part is his destructive behaviour. When we usually go out even for 15 ministers or so he starts tearing the wallpaper the bed covers and recently the wooden bathroom doors. Not only that but when we are home and not paying attention to him he makes a meal out of our flip flops and in one case my wifes watch! Weve tried everything from buying toys to treating him to making him wear a muzzle but he somehow always manages to destroy things.The worse part about it is the fact that he is well aware of his behaviour being unacceptable.

The Rainbow Bridgeinspired by a Norse legendBy the edge of a woods at the foot of a hillIs a lush green meadow where time stands still.Where the friends of man and woman do run...When their time on earth is over and done.For here between this world and the nextIs a place where each beloved creature finds rest.On this golden land they wait and they playTill the Rainbow Bridge they cross over one day.No more do they suffer in pain or in sadnessFor here they are whole their lives filled with gladness.Their limbs are restored their health renewedTheir bodies have healed with strength imbued.They romp through the grass without even a careUntil one day they start and sniff at the air.All ears prick forward eyes dart front and backThen all of a sudden one breaks from the pack.For just at that instant their eyes have met;Together again both person and pet.So they run to each other these friends from long pastThe time of their parting is over at last.The sadness they felt while they were apartHas turned into joy once more in each heart.They embrace with a love that will last foreverAnd then side-by-side they cross over… together.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>1.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.019277160176354897, 0.9807228398236452))</td><td>Brian Barczyk</td><td>2286160.0</td><td>I understand about the dog because when my dog died she could barely walk and I was so sad 😭 I cried so hard</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>1.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.12272468697395263, 0.8772753130260473))</td><td>Brian Barczyk</td><td>2324804.0</td><td>My dog cooper did 10-16-17 he was a weimeriemer he was my dog since 1 he lived a good life</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>1.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.28655097982042804, 0.7134490201795719))</td><td>Brian Barczyk</td><td>2330341.0</td><td>I have a dog to its all OK just think positive  and pray and it will be fine your dog will get better</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>1.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.00981379316237465, 0.9901862068376254))</td><td>Brian Barczyk</td><td>2334972.0</td><td>I know how you feel my dog died</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>1.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.2115620840869785, 0.7884379159130215))</td><td>BrookIvy3</td><td>967873.0</td><td>When I have to give my cat any meds I do as John does until it comes time to put the pill in their mouth.

I remember back when you couldnt even take pups to basic obedience classes until 6 months old. I start training the day I pick my pups up. Im looking to breed from my bitch in the future when she is a bit older. Only 16 months at the moment but out of  World Championship Herding line. Lots of high drive and incredibly intelligent bitch. Be a shame not to continue the bloodline. My bitch called Zed was the highest drive out of the litter and very feisty little biting thing naturally. Never known a BC with a fiull mouth bite but she has it and through tug and learning Object guarding along with agilityadvanced obedience and masses of tricks she is a very fulfilled girl.However it does take lots of time and commitment. I think your video called So you think you want a high drive puppy is very important .So many people get these working line dogs as pets and it is a disaster as the dogs simply are never fulfilled and as you know that leads to behavioural problems that your standard pet owners simply arent able to deal with at all.

Sometimes she will roll over on her back in her sleep.  It is not for my sake I ask.  It is because it seems wrong that she should react so strongly and I worry.  Any help would be so appreciated.

Other than not taking Beau our 7 year old Chocolate Labrador to our local dog park can you recommend what I should or can do to prevent dogs from becoming aggressive towards him? It’s only been occurring since January.Beau is a calm friendly and obedient dog in public however  during the last 11 months an extraordinary number of dogs have acted dangerously aggressive towards him. So far he’s only reacted defensively after  dogs attacked him on three separate occasions. Other times dogs will bark aggressively towards him but he’ll just stare him/her down and stand his ground. Never  once has he lunged aggressively towards another dog. Beau grew up with his uncle Riley who was 7 years older than him. Riley had a tough year and then we had to say goodbye to him this last March. It was devastating for all of us. During this time Beau was undersocialized but he did go for runs or long walks once or twice each day. I work at home so I also get to play with him often everyday. Since Riley passed so many dogs the same size or larger have acted extremely aggressive towards Beau. He’ll be healing dutifully on leash  or enjoying a wander around the dog park by himself when without warning a dog will make a beeline towards him lunge towards him and go for the throat. Every owner has said they are surprised of their dog’s aggressive behavior.At dog park I’ve always kept a close eye on Beau at all times and will stay within 3-4 feet of him. What more can I do to keep my dog safe? Also why do you think dogs are acting more aggressively towards Beau now? Without you being able to observe the situation I know it’ll be a guess but any thoughts or suggestions you might have is very much appreciated.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>1.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.08230294938716912, 0.9176970506128308))</td><td>Stray Rescue of St. Louis</td><td>471458.0</td><td>he looks exactly like my dog just a different color...so cuute</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>1.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.033644263766980854, 0.9663557362330192))</td><td>Super Menace</td><td>1716552.0</td><td>I love this dog. he is way less mean then my cat.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>1.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.15909952162549595, 0.8409004783745041))</td><td>Talking Kitty Cat</td><td>349227.0</td><td>tell selvester hes a fuckin bitch i love my kittys but kick himOUT OF YOUR HOUSE !!!!!!!!!!</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>1.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.14203312360121617, 0.8579668763987839))</td><td>Talking Kitty Cat</td><td>666934.0</td><td>Awwwww poor kitty I let my cats on the counter it doesnt do anything let them go on the counters plz</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>1.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.044343161833161386, 0.9556568381668387))</td><td>Talking Kitty Cat</td><td>741822.0</td><td>As i was watching this with my cat she scratched me in the eye</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>1.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.056711166092974635, 0.9432888339070253))</td><td>Talking Kitty Cat</td><td>1000614.0</td><td>We had to put my dog Lilly down.
