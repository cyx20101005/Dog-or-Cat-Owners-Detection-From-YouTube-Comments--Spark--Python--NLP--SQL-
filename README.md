## Dog or Cat Owners Detection From YouTube Comments (Spark, Python, NLP, SQL)
- Tried multiple ML models to detect the owners of dog or cat from unlabeled comments
- Preprocessed data by tokenizing comments and removing stop-word, and manually labeled comments into 1:100 imbalanced data, and utilized down-sampling to balance data
- Fine-tuned models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest and Gradient Boosting, and obtained the best model with a high AUC 0.959
- Applied the best model on unknown users and got insights into the most frequently used word of dog/cat owners
